### Hi there 👋

Hello my name is Benja! And lately I've been dreaming about data.

I found my passion, data analysis through digital strategies. With experience in SQL, Excel, R and Tableu.

Curious, energetic and eager to learn more about the world of programming and data. I classify myself as a data detective, I like to solve problems and find solutions that can lead to better day-to-day functioning.

A little nerdy, but... No, well yes, I'm very nerdy.

"I have no data yet." It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly, one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. - Sherlock Holmes

#Team Detective, in this world full of data.
